# Contributing

Changes to `main` require a pull request; an owner performs the final merge.

## Development

```console
task check
```

## Signing-key rotation

After a signing-key rotation, import the public key corresponding to
`REPO_WYRD_FOO_GPG_KEY` into an isolated GnuPG home, verify its full primary
fingerprint with the key owner, and set `SIGNING_FINGERPRINT` to that value.
Create the reviewed armored input and checked-in binary keyring with:

```console
gpg --batch --armor --export "$SIGNING_FINGERPRINT" >pubkey.asc
gpg --batch --yes --dearmor --output pubkey.gpg pubkey.asc
```
